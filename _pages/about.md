Being energetic and enthusiastic is my main motto in life. Life is full of challenges that require two attitudes to overcome them (1) an extensive range of knowledge in various areas, (2) and acquiring a problem solving manner with good communicative relations. I believe that I have these abilities in my arsenal and I hope to implement them in all aspects of my life.
